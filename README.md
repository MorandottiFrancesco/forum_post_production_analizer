Scripts which scrape a online game forum for posts about player productions status and filters the found content aggregating it in macro-variables which statistically analyze the data and produce graphs that help understanding the other players status.  


Furthermore the main definitions for the game engine are prepared for the next step, which would be to use the found data to run simulations of what could be the expected outcome of fighting that specific player.
